Based off of yesterday's code, we're going to add the ability to like a tweet. We describe this specific relationship between users and tweets as a "many to many" relationship. Meaning that a user can like many tweets and a tweet can be liked by many users!

> **Note:** This is a separate relationship from the one to many relationship between users and tweets that we built yesterday. That relationship could be called "tweets" or "posted tweets", whereas this relationship should be called "liked tweets".

## The world so far - completed user stories

* Create a User class. The class should have these methods:
  * `#initialize` which takes a username and have
  * a reader method for the username
  * `#tweets` that returns an array of Tweet instances
  * `#post_tweet` that takse a message, creates a new tweet, and adds it to the user's tweet collection
* Create a Tweet class. The class should have these methods:
  * `Tweet#message` that returns a string
  * `Tweet#user` that returns an instance of the user class
  * `Tweet.all` that returns all the Tweets created.
  * `Tweet#username` that returns the username of the tweet's user
